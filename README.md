<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

K4-Systems is a plugin that enhances the server with features such as a playtime tracker, statistical records, and player ranks. Additionally, it includes VIP functions and admin commands for added functionality.

### Official Addons

You can get these addons to make K4 and your server gameplay much better:

- [**K4-Missions**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/k4ryuu/e/212956): This masterpiece lets you create your own missions to your server, through a really easy json file (5 line per mission). You don't have to configure big codes or so, just easily add few words and the mission is generated automatically. Normal players have less mission slots than VIPs so it's good to entertain your players and get more rank purchase possibly. The code is really really complex for the basic level of CSS scripts, because the hooks are made "dynamically" to support everything.
- [**K4-System Matchmaking Ranks**](https://github.com/K4ryuu/K4-System-MMRanks): Display K4-System points as prime points or matchmaking ranks on scoreboard. Probably you have to install a metamod addon in order to reveal all player's rank, but you find that in the issues of that plugin.
