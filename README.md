<!-- ADDONS -->

### Official Addons

You can get these addons to make K4 and your server gameplay much better:

- [**K4-Missions**](https://nests.kitsune-lab.com/store/view/16): This masterpiece lets you create your own missions to your server, through a really easy json file (5 line per mission). You don't have to configure big codes or so, just easily add few words and the mission is generated automatically. Normal players have less mission slots than VIPs so it's good to entertain your players and get more rank purchase possibly. Support every other plugin also which has any command to give something.
- [**K4-System Matchmaking Ranks**](https://github.com/KitsuneLab-Development/K4-System-MMRanks): Display K4-System points as prime points or matchmaking ranks on scoreboard. Probably you have to install a metamod addon in order to reveal all player's rank, but you find that in the issues of that plugin.
